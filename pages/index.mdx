<Text variant="subtitle">Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a consumer to a creator. Suddenly, computers become a tool for creating.<br />
There’s never been a better time for making: anywhere in the world, anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can learn to make an app. Building things has never been so globally democratized.<br />
**The goal of Hack Club is to help you become a hacker (aka coder).** We want a space at every school where people are making interesting things with code, every week. Schools don’t provide that, so we’re creating it in every school to make building things accessible to everyone.<br />
Most coding classes teach you programming concepts instead of how to write real code—it’s like trying to learn carpentry without any wood. So at Hack Club, you learn to code entirely through building things. You start with no experience and build and ship a project every meeting.<br />
Just as the best carpenters didn’t learn in the classroom, neither did the best programmers. Through our <Link href="https://hackclub.com/workshops">workshops</Link>, you’ll be walked through building projects. Starting out, you won’t understand how the code works, but you’ll build understanding as you go. You’ll get stuck along the way, but we’re here to help.<br />
Hack Club gives you a worldwide community of thousands of other young makers to talk to. We’re artists, writers, engineers, tinkerers, campers, filmmakers, volunteers. We make things. We help one another. We have fun. Join us.</Text>
