We are planning for you to do some or all of the following:
1) Microbiology, bacterial transformations, plasmid preps;
2) cell culture - growing cells like HeLa cells and transferring them with plasmids;
3) Fluorescence imaging (confocal, and total internal reflection fluorescence);
4) Immunoprecipitations;
5) Western blots;
6) FlexStation robotic cell signalling assays.
