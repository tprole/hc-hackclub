    # How was this site made?

    Firstly, I'd like to attribute Hack Club for their fantastically useful resources over at <Link href="theme.hackclub.com">theme.hackclub.com</Link>, which contains a huge bank of elements usable for web development.
    I used their starter page to create this site. To manipulate this page, a basic knowledge of HTML, React and JavaScript is useful. <br />

    This is what the code editor for the home page looks like: <br />
    <Card variant="interactive"><Image src={"Screenshot 2023-06-24 at 11.58.59 AM.png"} /></Card>

    <br />

    Basically, I imported a bunch of components from the Hack Club Theme UI toolkit, and then created instances of those in a markdown file (.mdx). This uses some HTML syntax and some JavaScript syntax, and some regular old text editing skills, if you're familiar with those. <br />
    If you want to create a website like this of your own, email me at <Link href="mailto:tprole@havergal.on.ca">tprole@havergal.on.ca</Link> and I can give you a hand!
